To save time later in the DEMO we should populate this before configuring the ONPREM environment.  
There are two VPN connections ... one between AWS and ONPREM ROUTER1 and one between AWS and ONPREM ROUTER2  
For each of those there are two tunnels ... AWS Endpoint A -> ONPREMROUTER  
and AWS endpointB -> ONPREMROUTER  

Those are the details we will populate

# INSTRUCTIONS ON GETTING THE VALUES

We will be locating values for a specific connection `CONN1` or `CONN2` and a specific tunnel .. `TUNNEL1` or `TUNNEL2`  

For anything starting with CONN1 .. Look in the `CONNECTION1CONFIG.TXT` file  
For anything starting with CONN2 .. Look in the `CONNECTION2CONFIG.TXT` file  
In each of the above files, for anything showing TUNNEL1 fine the section `IPSec Tunnel #1` in the above files (THE TOP HALF)  
In each of the above files, for anything showing TUNNEL2 fine the section `IPSec Tunnel #2` in the above files (THE BOTTOM HALF)  

For `ROUTER1_PRIVATE_IP` its the 192.168.12.SOMETHING Private IPv4 Address for `ROUTER1` - Check the `Outputs` of the `ONPREM` CFN Stack for `Private IP of Router1`  
For `ROUTER2_PRIVATE_IP` its the 192.168.12.SOMETHING Private IPv4 Address for `ROUTER2` - Check the `Outputs` of the `ONPREM` CFN Stack for `Private IP of Router2`
